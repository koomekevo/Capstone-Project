# HTML-CSS-capstone-project-Conference-Page

>This HTML-CSS Capstone Project is about an online chess conference for chess fans and is meant to showcase the skills I have mastered in HTML and CSS. I have also used Bootstrap for CSS Grid and Flexbox, Font Awesome for vector icons in the project, and Jquery, a popular Javascript library.
